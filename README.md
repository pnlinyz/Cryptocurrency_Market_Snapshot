# Cryptocurrency_Market_Snapshot
Major cryptocurrencies are under pressure since May 2021. I'd like to take a snapshot of the current market by reviewing price, trasaction colume and market cap of major cryptocurrencies.

This project goes through the whole process of getting cryptocurrency list, scrape market data and data visualization.
